There are some rules that you need to follow:
- Try to create de code in order to be easy to read and maintain.
- Prefer use scss.module instead to use style div property.
- Include a global.scss that should contains standard variables. like colors, font's size and media sizes. 
- DO NOT create files more than 100 lines of code. Try to modularize.
- Try always to follow a design standard. Like button or block pattern. 
- Try to create reusable components. Force the others components use that.
- Try always to separate the logic with the rendering. 
- Delete the unnecessary classname, or class that are not longer use it.
